# Azure Active Directory OAuth

A Flutter OAuth package for performing user authentication against Azure Active Directory OAuth2 v2.0 endpoint. Forked from [hitherejoe.FlutterOAuth](https://github.com/hitherejoe/FlutterOAuth).

Supported Flows:

- [Authorization code flow (including refresh token flow)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
- [Authorization code flow B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/authorization-code-flow)

## Usage

For using this library you have to create an azure app at the [Azure App registration portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/). Use native app as platform type (with callback URL: https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf).

Afterwards you have to initialize the library as follow:

```dart
final Config config = new Config(
  "YOUR TENANT ID",
  "YOUR CLIENT ID",
  "openid profile offline_access",
  "your redirect url available in azure portal");
final AadOAuth oauth = new AadOAuth(config);
```

This allows you to pass in an tenant ID, client ID, scope and redirect url.

Then once you have an OAuth instance, you can call `login()` and afterwards `getAccessToken()` to retrieve an access token:

```dart
await oauth.login();
String accessToken = await oauth.getAccessToken();
```

You can also call `getAccessToken()` directly. It will automatically login and retrieve an access token.

Tokens are stored in Keychain for iOS or Keystore for Android. To destroy the tokens you can call `logout()`:

```dart
await oauth.logout();
```

## B2C Usage

Setup your B2C directory - [Azure AD B2C Setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant/).
<br></br>Register an App on the previously created B2C directory - [Azure AD B2C App Register](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=applications).
<br></br>Use native app as plattform type (with callback URL: https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf).
<br></br>Create your user flows - [Azure AD B2C User Flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

Add your Azure tenant ID, tenantName, client ID (ID of App), client Secret (Secret of App) and redirectUrl in the main.dart source-code:

```dart
static final Config configB2C = new Config(
    "YOUR_TENANT_ID",
    "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "YOUR_CLIENT_ID offline_access",
    "https://login.live.com/oauth20_desktop.srf",
    clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    isB2C: true,
    azureTennantName: "YOUR_TENANT_NAME",
    userFlow: "YOUR_USER_FLOW",
    tokenIdentifier: "UNIQUE IDENTIFIER A",
  );
```

Afterwards you can login and get an access token for accessing other resources.

## Installation
